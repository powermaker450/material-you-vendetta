# Material Not You

These are "Material You" concepts I created based on the way I like Material-You themes: Dark, low contrast, awesome for OLED screens. Again, proofs of concept, this is **NOT** a Material-You mod for Vendetta.

## "Can you make a theme with [#HEXCODE]?"

Yes.

## "I don't like the way [THEME] looks. Can you change it?"

If you tell me exactly what to change and what to change it to.

## "THANK YOU!!! THESE THEMES ARE SUPER AWESOME!!!"

No problem. Glad you like it.
